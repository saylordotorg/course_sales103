**Unit 2: Ethics in Professional Sales** <span id="2"></span> 
*Sales professions inherently involve the act of persuasion between the
sales person and the potential customer. Communication between two or
more individuals, especially when it focuses on a persuasive act,
invites the opportunity for deception and unethical tactics. We all need
to adhere to some level of ethical behavior to allow for sustained
successful communication. To be a successful sales professional, it is
paramount that you develop a relationship based on trust with your
clients and potential clients. Trust is a crucial element to a
successful sales career.  
    
 As a sales professional, you should consider ethical standards of your
own as well as those of the organization or industry for which you work.
Whether the sales position involves quick transactions or prolonged
negotiations, your credibility will go a long way in determining your
success or failure as a sales professional.*

**Unit 2 Summary** <span id="2.4"></span> 
Regardless of the sales position you enter, your credibility will be
integral to your success and longevity. A sales professional must be
able to establish and maintain positive relationships with clients.
These relationships can be challenging because of the element of
persuasion inherent within the interactions. Persuasive attempts can
more easily be made, and relationships maintained, when trust and
credibility are present.
