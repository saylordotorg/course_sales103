**Unit 3: Sales Presentations** <span id="3"></span> 
*At the heart of every sales position, there is a component of skill.
Ultimately, successful sales persons must be able to develop a sales
presentation, present it to prospects, and then ask for the order.
Knowing when and where to find prospective clients is the start of the
process. Once a potential client base is identified, the sales
professional must then adapt a presentation for that target audience
that presents their product or service in a persuasive manner. This unit
will help you learn to prepare for and present an effective sales
presentation. As part of this process, you will be asked to prepare a
short sales presentation and record it. You will then post the video to
the Saylor Discussion Forum and make it available for critique by your
classmates. You will also be asked to reflect on your own sales video
and evaluate your work.*

    you have learned so far in the course, use your knowledge to

    presentation and evaluate yourself using the following criteria: 

    1.  Did I make my presentation with adequate clarity and conviction?
    2.  Did I articulate features and benefits in my presentation?
    3.  Did I appear to be credible and trustworthy in my presentation?
    4.  Was the use of the SPIN technique evident in the presentation?
    5.  Did I employ appeals using logic, emotion, or credibility?
    6.  Were my thoughts and arguments coherent and without obvious
        error?
    7.  Were the transitions between thoughts in my presentation
        relatively smooth?
    8.  Did I incorporate an effective close in the presentation?
    9.  What objections would I anticipate from people who heard this
        sales presentation?
    10. What three to five things could I improve on in this
        presentation?

    Completing this sales presentation activity should take
    approximately 4 hours.
