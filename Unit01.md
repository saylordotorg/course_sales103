**Unit 1: Sales Positions** <span id="1"></span> 
*Beginning a sales career can be very exciting and offers a wide range
of professional possibilities. Diving head first into a list of want ads
can be time consuming and may lead to applying for sales positions that
do not fit your strengths and desires. When considering a sales career,
it is helpful to look at the profession from a general perspective,
exploring the types of sales positions available. Looking at the sales
profession in this way does not mean studying the different varieties of
products and services you could sell – although, that is important too.
Instead, you want to look at broader considerations, such as whether a
sales opportunity requires multiple and frequent sales like selling used
cars or whether the position has more sporadic sales over a longer
period of time like airplane sales. Another difference to examine is
whether a position requires you to go find customers and clients or if
your customers come to you.  
    
 In this unit, you will learn the primary distinctions between different
types of sales positions and how sales professionals are compensated.*
