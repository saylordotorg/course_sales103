recruited into the position and engaging in sales training. Over time,

**Unit 4 Summary** <span id="4.3"></span> 
Sales is often thought of as an individual process. However, you will
more likely be a member of a sales team. The team element introduces
issues of training, working with others, staff motivation, and possibly
competition. Recognizing the variables present in sales teams and being
comfortable with them will be helpful in your career. Those who excel in
these areas might have the opportunity to move into management
positions. Unit 4 provides an overview of the team element in sales from
both the sales person and sales management perspectives.  
    
 Based on your previous work and experiences assess how you might
perform as a sales team leader. What would your skills and strengths be?
What type of leadership or managerial approaches do you think you would
use? What skills and knowledge do you think you need to develop now, or
during your sales career, that would make you qualified to be a sales
team leader in the future?
